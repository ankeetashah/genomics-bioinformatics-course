# Genomics and Bioinformatics Course Material

*BC3308 Genomics and Bioinformatics, Spring 2016: I aided in the development and design (and also was a teaching assistant) of this new course at Barnard College*

Course Description: Advanced topics in genetics focusing on genome-level features and methods of sequence analysis. The primary emphasis of the course will be on microbial genomic and metagenomic applications but many of the techniques will be applicable to eukaryotic genomics and medical genomics as well. Through this course students will become comfortable with the command line interface, learn basic programming skills, be exposed to a variety of online tools, and become proficient in a number of genomic software packages. 

### command-line-basics: ### 
* solutions to Bandit game from [OverTheWire] (http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
* using basic linux commands to extract information from a file in BED format

### basic-sequence-analysis: ###
* a script to reverse complement a sequence
* a script to translate mRNA to protein
* a script to extract GC content of a sequence
* a script to convert a fasta file into a fastq file 

### bioinformatics-algorithms: ###
* the lecture I gave on alignment and clustering algorithms 
* sample homework assignment associated with said lecture
